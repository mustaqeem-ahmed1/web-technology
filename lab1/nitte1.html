   <h3>About Us</h3>
   <h4>NMIT was started by Vinaya Hegde, son of founder of NMAMIT, late Justice K. S. Hegde in 2001 after the success of Nitte Mahalinga Adyanathaya Memorial Institute of Technology (NMAMIT) at Nitte. The campus is on a 23-acre (93,000 m2) site in Govindapura, Gollahalli village 3 km from Baglur cross, on the way to Devanahalli airport on Hyderabad-Bangalore NH 7 and it is 25 km from Centre of Bengaluru.</h4>
   <h4>Recognized as one of the finest educational institutions in Karnataka with students from all over India and abroad.The campuses have professionally and aesthetically designed buildings, surrounded by gardens making it a highly conducive centre for learning. Each is a self-contained campus with separate hostels for men and women with staff wardens, telephone and Internet facilities, co-operative stores, post office and a bank. The system of teacher guardianship, wherein a group of students are assigned to a teacher is a unique feature of our institutions. This system helps a teacher attend to each student especially those who are weak academically. Professional campus counsellors interact with students having personal, disciplinary or emotional problems.</h4>
